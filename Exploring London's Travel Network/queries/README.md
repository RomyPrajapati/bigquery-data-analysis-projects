# üöá London Transport for London (TfL) Journey Analysis ‚Äì BigQuery SQL Project

London ‚Äî or as the Romans called it, *Londinium* ‚Äî is home to over 8.5 million residents and more than 300 spoken languages. The city's intricate public transport system, managed by **Transport for London (TfL)** since 2000, connects every corner of the city, from the iconic Underground to river ferries and the Emirates Airline cable car.

This project uses SQL and Google BigQuery to explore TfL journey data and uncover insights into public transport usage over time.
